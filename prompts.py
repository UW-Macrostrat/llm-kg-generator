## Task and Context 
You will be given a paragraph from an academic paper regarding geology. Your task is to identify and extract relationship triplets that match any of the following relationships:

    "stratigraphic unit has lithology of"
    "lithology has color of"

Each extracted relationship must match a relationship in the list above.

For each identified relationship, provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, and format your findings as a list of objects where each object contains the following keys:

    reasoning: Detail your reasoning behind why the relationship found in the text matches one of the relationships in the shortlist.
    head: Specify the subject of the relationship (should only be one stratigraphic unit or lithologic unit).
    tail: Specify the object of the relationship (should only be one stratigraphic unit or lithologic unit).
    relationship: Cite the specific relationship from the list above that you have identified. The relationship you cite must have an exact matching in the list above.

## Style Guide
Your output must be in valid json and follow this format:

{{
  "reasoning": Explain whether any relevant triplets are found in the text.
  "triplets": A list of triplets, should be empty if no relevant ones are found

Current designations of the age of the Silurian for­ mations are shown in figure 16. The ages indicated by Rexroad and Nicoll (1971,1972) and Liebe and Rexroad (1977) are based on conodont studies, while those of Berry and Boucot (1970) rely mainly on brachiopods. No physical evidence exists for a significant hiatus anywhere within or at the base of the Silurian, although there is some evidence of minor erosion (locally derived pebbles) at the base of the Brassfield in a few outcrops near Berea (Weir, 1976). Gray and Boucot (1972) pre­ sent evidence of shallowing water in latest Ordovician time followed by deepening water in the Silurian, which they regard as indicating a paraconformity at the sys­ temic boundary. Sweet (1979), on the basis of conodont studies, shows the uppermost Ordovician to be missing. The hiatus shown between the ""Noland Formation"" and the Estill Shale on the first three nomenclature columns in figure 16 is based on the supposed absence of conodont Zone II of Walliser (Rexroad and others, 1965, p. 24), and the hiatus shown at the base of the Silurian is presumed because of the thinness of the lower part of the conodont Zone I (Rexroad, 1967). Later discovery of Zone II conodonts (Rexroad, 1970, p.

  "reasoning": "The abstract describes two stratigraphic units within the cap carbonate sequence, each with distinct lithologies and color attributes. The first unit is a 'microcrystalline dolostone' with a 'buff-weathering' characteristic, indicating its lithology and color. The second unit mentioned is an 'upper limestone' that varies in facies, including 'peloidal lime grainstone and mudstone,' 'cementstone,' 'lime wackestone and mudstone,' and 'calcite cementstones,' which suggests different lithologies within the limestone stratigraphy. Additionally, the color of the calcite crystals, implied by 'crystal stromatolites,' although not directly mentioned, can be inferred as part of the limestone's characteristic, given the context of geological studies where color can be linked to specific minerals or their weathering states. However, explicit color descriptions for these lithologies are not provided.",

The largest fossil placer known in the Upper Cretaceous rocks of Wyoming was reported by Dow and Batty (1961, p. 26-30) to be a channel deposit in sandstone of the Mesaverde Formation exposed at Dugout Creek in Washakie County. Like the deposit on Mud Creek, the placer on Dugout Creek is also divided into two segments by stream erosion. The northern segment is exposed for a length of 5,300 feet and a width of 1,000 feet with an average thickness of 20 feet. Extensions toward the north and west are covered by younger rocks. The southern segment has an exposed length of 6,400 feet, width of 1,900 feet, and an average thickness of 18 feet. It is pos-"

In type area consists of light-colored tuffaceous sandstone, thin coal and carbonaceous shale beds, and yellowish to greenish bentonite beds. These overlie sandstone of Mesaverde formation. In Spread Creek Canyon, an exposure in center of syncline includes 166 feet o·f strata consisting of gray to chalky gray siltstone with large biotite flakes, white granular biotite tuff, carbonaceous claystone and shale, thin impure coal beds, and yellow to green bentonite beds. About 675 feet exposed on west limb of Spread Creek anticline. Younger Cretaceous rocks not observed in contact with Meeteetse. Stratigraphically below Harebell formation; contact not observed. Plant remains suggest Upper Cretaceous age.

  "reasoning": "The text provides information about various geological formations and their compositions. Two specific relationships can be identified based on the provided descriptions: 1) The Mesaverde Formation is described as being composed of sandstone, indicating a 'stratigraphic unit has lithology of' relationship. 2) The described lithology includes 'light-colored tuffaceous sandstone, thin coal and carbonaceous shale beds, and yellowish to greenish bentonite beds,' and 'gray to chalky gray siltstone with large biotite flakes, white granular biotite tuff, carbonaceous claystone and shale, thin impure coal beds, and yellow to green bentonite beds,' which gives us a hint about the color of these lithologies, suggesting a 'lithology has color of' relationship. However, the colors are associated with lithologies in a descriptive way rather than a direct 'has color of' relationship, thus making it ambiguous to definitively assign a 'lithology has color of' relationship.",
