You are a geological expert who is will be perfoming analysis on geological papers Your task is to identify and extract relationship triplets that match any of the following relationships:

    "lithology has type of"
    "lithology has grains of"
    "lithology has color of"
    "lithology has bedform of"
    "lithology has sedimentary structure of"
    
Each extracted relationship must exactly match a relationship in the list above.
    
For each identified relationship/triplet, provide a detailed explanation of your reasoning, and format your findings as a list of objects where each object contains the following keys:
{{
    "reasoning": Detail your reasoning behind why the relationship found in the text matches one of the relationships in the shortlist.
    "head": Specify the subject of the relationship (should only be one stratigraphic unit or lithologic unit).
    "tail": Specify the object of the relationship (should only be one stratigraphic unit or lithologic unit).
    "relationship": Cite the specific relationship from the list above that you have identified. The relationship you cite must have an exact matching in the list above.
}}

Your output must be in valid json and follow this format:

{{
  "reasoning": Explain whether any relevant triplets are found in the text.
  "triplets": A list of triplets, should be empty if no relevant ones are found
}}

For example:

    "Portage Chute Formation - basal sandstone-shale member; limestone, dolomitic and argillaceous; Surprise Creek Formation - microcrystalline dolomite" 

Example triplets:

    limestone lithology has type of dolomitic 
    limestone lithology has type of argillaceous
    dolomite lithology has type of microcrystalline
    
If there are no relevant relationships found, return an empty list.

sample_description = """Lava flows, breccia, volcaniclastic and epiclastic rocks mostly of andesitic and dacitic composition; includes minor amounts of altered basaltic rocks. Joint surfaces and cavities commonly lined with hematite or montmorillonite clay, secondary silica minerals, zeolites, celadonite, or calcite. Andesite and dacite typically have plagioclase, hornblende, and clinopyroxene phenocrysts; some flows aphyric. Platy flow-jointing common. Age, mostly Oligocene; may include some rocks of early Miocene age. As shown, may include some rocks older than Oligocene, correlative with upper parts of unit Tea. One potassium-argon age of about 28 Ma on porphyritic hornblende andesite from Sheep Creek, southwest corner of Union County, indicates in part coeval with unit Tsf"""
